This freedom that's bestowed on us    is not devoid of suffering.Each tie we cut exercises    our tolerance of agony.Relinquish the comforts of    mind and flesh for thoughts to let shrinkand relish the silent breathing.    Relinquish these ties to be free.Suffering of the saints, the martyrs    are cast from the same hardened mould—fights indistinguishable from    each other, as the battered remainsreminds the other of paths that    destinies might have had foretold.Both fights are but fights of freedom    fought in their own unyielding ways.A fight of the middle class and    a plight of downtrodden and poor;sufferings in lieu of comfort,    sharp blades in lieu of bouquets.Choices shroud the destined outcomes    lurking beyond translucent doorsopened their own definition    of freedom—would’ve chosen anyways!There aren't leftist propagandas,    no doctrines of righteous right,no drug psychotropic enough    for truth that illusion portrays;or the temporal suspension of    reality for our delight—As we search for our own freedom    ourselves, in our own selfish ways.This freedom that's bestowed on you    is not devoid of sufferingsduring your spatial–temporal     stroll through a predetermined world.Was suffering your exercise in    your mindful self-discoverywhile you and your freedom wait    for the certain future to unfurl?

**_Note:_** I was meditating on the idea of freedom and how discomfort and suffering is a part of achieving any form of freedom—mental, physical, or spiritual. I also found it amusing that no matter how we take the suffering, we wouldn't be drifting away from a deterministic world if that is the case. —_S.B. (16.05.2020)_
