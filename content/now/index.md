An instructional piece on personal finance called [Y-Finance](https://sauvikbiswas.com/wp/YF/).

[publisher](https://github.com/sauvikbiswas/publisher): Static site generator. Updates and commits are more frequent as I am using it to publish Y-Finance. I have asked a friend in NIT Patna to use it for writing his mathematics class notes.
