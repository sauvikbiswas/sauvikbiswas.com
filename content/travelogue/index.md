## Tawang and West Kameng, Arunachal Pradesh, December 2020

{{< figure src="DSC07098-150x150.jpg" width="150" class="left" >}}

This was my first visit to Arunachal. It was on a whim that I decided to head there; that too, during pandemic. With no certainty of the situation in North-East and the ever-changing state-border protocols, I wasn't sure if I would be able to go past Guwahati. Fortunately, with a little help from my friends, things started falling in place—as if my going there was predestined.

## Kinnaur-Spiti, Himachal Pradesh, June–August 2019

{{< figure src="DSC06345-150x150.jpg" width="150" class="left" >}}

This trip was the slowest one I had personally done till date. I was trying my best to soak in the essence of a place. Yet, once I was back home, it felt like I had rushed through many of the places. As always, Himachal had been very welcoming. There was a sense of serenity that I was able to touch but not carry back with me. Next time, I'll take it even slower.

## Munich-Prague-Berlin-Brussels, December 2018

{{< figure src="DSC5420-150x150.jpg" width="150" class="left" >}}

This was the first time that I had travelled to Europe. I was on some work assignment and had a month long plan. I was done with my work in the first two weeks. For the next two weeks, I backpacked through three places and touched over another. Partho—a friend from my university days—accompanied me for some of the days and helped me out in many ways.

## Garhwal Uttarakhand, December 2017

{{< figure src="PICT_20171218_091613-150x150.jpg" width="150" class="left" >}}

This was my ritual year-end trip. I have tried doing more hikes this time, including one with an organised group. I had learned many lessons from my Himachal trip two years ago. As a result, I was well prepared to experience low temperatures and snow. Also, _Garhwalis_ can rival _Himachalis_ with their hospitality and helpfulness.

## Mangalore-Udupi, October 2017

{{< figure src="DSC03728-150x150.jpg" width="150" class="left" >}}

Up until this point, I had not taken any vacations in 2017. Part of it was due to my work schedule and part of it was due to my sister spraining her ankle when she had last visited Bangalore. I insisted that they come and visit Bangalore after _Durga Puja_ so that we could do our annual trip.

## Tour of Nilgiris, December 2016

{{< figure src="IMG_20161220_103453-150x150.jpg" width="150" class="left" >}}

I entered myself into this 8 day, 900 km long cycling tour without knowing what to expect. I learned a lot more about myself in this trip than any other past ones. It was hard. At times I suffered. Yet, in the end, it was one of the most enjoyable trips I had done till date.

## Kodaikanal-Ooty, April-May, 2016

{{< figure src="DSC00184-150x150.jpg" width="150" class="left" >}}

I had planned a longer trip but the unexpected heat in this region forced me, my sister and my mom to opt for cooler places. Some of my colleagues suggested Kodaikanal and Ooty. They had also asked me not to do anything but enjoy the weather. I couldn't resist walking around. In the end, I realised that my colleagues were right.

## Himachal Pradesh, December, 2015

{{< figure src="DSC05082-150x150.jpg" width="150" class="left" >}}

This was my first solo backpacking trip. I covered a good area of Himachal Pradesh mostly on buses and locally by foot (and in a few inevitable cases, on cars) just before majority of the state was about to shut down due to snow. My target was to start from the Northern areas and move South-East. This helped me escape the onslaught of the freezing cold (although it eventually caught up with me). I had mostly good, some average and some hilarious experiences on my way. I also got to know a lot about the locals and a bit of myself.

## Vietnam, May - June, 2015

{{< figure src="DSC04163-150x150.jpg" width="150" class="left" >}}

I did this trip with Nitesh Nandy - the same friend with whom I had backpacked through North-East India in 2014. One of my goals was to travel ultralight. I learned quite a lot from Nandy since he had some prior experience of backpacking in Thailand. If you read through the entries, you'll find the repeated use of the phrase, "this was the strongest coffee I have tasted till date". In fact, this is exactly what had happened. When I thought coffee couldn't get stronger, I got introduced to a different cup at a different place.

## Kerala, March - April, 2015

{{< figure src="DSC03445_1600_2133-150x150.jpg" width="150" class="left" >}}

I did this trip with my mother and sister. The trip itself was broken into two different itineraries. It would have been taxing on my mother to do a 10 day long trip. Technically, I had not backpacked, but had borrowed some backpacking ethos - e.g., minimal luggage, booking en route, hunting good eateries, etc.

## North-East India, December, 2014

{{< figure src="DSC02355_1600_1200-150x150.jpg" width="150" class="left" >}}

My friend, Nitesh Nandy, introduced me to the idea of backpacking. I had done remote, multi-day trekking before but had not backpacked. The idea of not planning the route ahead was an intriguing and frightening thought to me. Yet, I took a plunge. This turned out to be one of my most memorable trips. In some ways, this trip helped me shed some bit of inhibition towards approaching strangers.
