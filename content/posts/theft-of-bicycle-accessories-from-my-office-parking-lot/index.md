Something unthinkable happened last evening. Someone stole my cycle's headlamp and cyclocomputer display unit (along with its mount). All this happened while the bike was parked in the [Xylem](https://www.google.co.in/maps/place/Xylem/@12.9944175,77.7016962,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x4f8a69a3343bdc60) premises (where I work). The thief was not aware of the quick-release mechanisms in the mounts. As a result there were quite a few marks on my cycle's handlebar. Thankfully these were not permanent scratches.

I called up the security and lodged a report. Today, when I got to work, I found that the company which provided security had changed. It appeared to me that some security personnel from the older company thought that it was a good idea to accumulate some devices on his last day of work in the premises. While the headlamp can be used as a powerful torch, the cyclocomputer display unit is useless without the sensor which is still mounted on my bicycle's fork.

A disheartening mail to the concerned persons ensured, which was later forwarded and circulated amongst the Xylem security and estate managers. They "assured" me that the chances of getting the devices back or catching the thief is near zero but they will take all necessary actions.

Cumulatively, the loss is about INR 4500. Here are the images of the items stolen.

I usually, took them off whenever I parked my cycle in public places but never in my office parking lot.
