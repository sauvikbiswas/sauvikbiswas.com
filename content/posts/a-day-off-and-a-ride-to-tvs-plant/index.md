26th January was a holiday. It was also a Thursday. I decided to take the Friday off and wander around. (I did some more random stuff that weekend, but that's for another blog post.)

I had never cycled beyond Silk Board, towards the Tamil Nadu border. So, I decided to cycle to Hosur and pay Mogit a visit at the [TVS factory](https://goo.gl/maps/S9kX3NCPaqt).

I wanted to start early but low visibility, early in the morning, delayed my plans. Eventually, I started at around 8:00 am. Mogit had advised me not to take the Electronic City expressway. Instead, I used the regular, traffic-signal regulated road that runs beneath it. The traffic wasn't as bad as I had thought it to be. The route was relatively traffic free. One of the reasons that I can think of would be people taking a day off just to get an extended weekend - just like what I had done.

The road to Hosur is quite flat. There are a few nice flyovers that overarch the chaos of settlements. This isn't unlike the Kolar route that I frequent. The following picture was taken atop one of those flyovers.

There are a few ways to get to TVS factory. I continued on National Highway 44 and crossed Karnataka-Tamil Nadu border, took a U-turn at Sipcot and headed into a village road (Ballur road?) that lead to Amritha, another area near the border where TVS two wheeler factory is located.

I gave Mogit a call and asked him to join me for some tea (and chocolates). It took him about 15 minutes to get out. It turns out that his office is located quite far from the gate and even if he ran (which he admitted to having done in order to catch a bus), it would take him 7 minutes to reach the gate.

There wasn't any tea shop nearby. We walked for about half a kilometre to reach the nearest bakery. As usual, I refilled my water bottle. Although this time, I had to fill it with water from an RO filter as the shop did not stock packaged drinking water.

While returning, I decided to take the inside route that connected Amritha to Attibele, a town on the National Highway.

I remember this one time when I had visited [an observatory located somewhere south-west of Hosur](/posts/a-visit-to-the-observatory-at-yoga-nikaya/). I recognised that area near Attibele junction where we stocked ourselves with some food and beverages before proceeding to the observatory.

I can definitely feel some improvements in my cycling. I know that I am nowhere near the base physical level required to challenge Kalahatty. I have to lose about 5 more kgs of fat from my body.
