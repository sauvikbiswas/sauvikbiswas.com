## Bidding Dharamshala goodbye

My four days at Dharamshala was a very pleasing and memorable experience. I had a chat with Nandy (the guy with whom I did the [North-East ’14 trip](http://sauvikbiswas.com/tag/north-east-trip-14/) and the [Vietnam ’15 trip](http://sauvikbiswas.com/tag/vietnam-trip-15/)). He had been to the place before and mentioned that he could stay there for weeks and not feel bored. I agreed with him.

Ganesh had been a nice host. He gave a lot of pointers and some of them were really helpful. After all, he has been in the business for the last 10 years.

At Dharamshala bus stop, I had two choices. I could either move towards Kangra or head towards Palampur, which would be on my way towards Mandi. I decided to take a detour to Kangra. It took me one hour to reach Kangra.

Kangra is not frequented by travellers like me. The tourist crowd mostly consists of religious pilgrims. I got a room near the new bus stop. For 650 rupees, it is one of the worst I have seen. Probably, last year’s hotel at Kohima may give it a tough competition.

## Remains of Kangra Fort

I dropped my bag and rushed out. (I did not even waste two minutes). I caught a bus and got down at a place where NH 503 meets the Baner Khad. This junction is about a kilometre from [Kangra Fort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangra_Fort). The fort is now in rubbles. The 1905 Kangra earthquake had destroyed it along with older structures like St. John's Church in the wilderness [I had visited yesterday](/posts/day-7-three-dharams-in-dharamshala/). The monarchy and history of the Kangra region passes through multiple people and lineages in power. The fort was built in 1500 BCE.

There is a small exhibit inside the fort compound by ASI. There is also a private exhibit known as Maharaja Sansar Chandra museum adjacent to the fort that is run by the royal family. Photography was prohibited at both places. The latter had a nice printed timeline of Kangra's history.

## Brajeshwari Devi temple or the goddess of Kangra

Kangra is known for its [Brajeshwari Devi temple](http://www.tripadvisor.in/Attraction_Review-g1380886-d2708935-Reviews-Bajreshwari_Devi_Temple-Kangra_Himachal_Pradesh.html). It is a mainstream attraction. Even in this off season, there were a considerable crowd inside. Also, unlike all other temples I had visited, this one had facilities that one expects from a place that expects crowd. I kept my shoes at a stall. When I returned, there was no one at the stall. I took my shoes and walked away. Then again it could have been anyone else walking away with my shoes.

On my way back, I stopped at a crowded street food joint that sold Aloo Tikki and Burgers. Just like all street foods, the Aloo Tikki was tasty and unhealthy.
