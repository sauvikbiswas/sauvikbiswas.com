## Getting from Kasol to Shimla

One reason why I wanted to get down to Shimla was because it is easier to get to Delhi rather than from Kullu or even Mandi. I would be catching a bus tomorrow.

When I left Kasol at 8:00 am, it was freezing cold. Not to mention, the Sun had not shown its face in Kasol yet.

It took me full two hours to reach Bhuntar via the 35 km long road. The bus stopped every five minutes to pick up the passengers. I know that I wouldn't be getting any option for food anytime sooner. I had two _aloo parthas_ so that I did not have to go hungry. It was a good decision. That's because after two hours and two buses later, when I was in Mandi, I found an express Volvo that was departing for Shimla.

## At Shimla

The Volvo took over five hours from Mandi to Shimla through NH 88 via Sunderpur. I also found a companion whose name is Krishnavatar Gupta. He is on a solo trip, too.

The Volvo dropped us at new bus stand or [ISBT Shimla](https://goo.gl/maps/hyQzrHTv53B2).

We took another local bus till old bus stand. As soon as we got down, we were flaked by brokers who promised us cheap and great rooms near Mall road. No matter how much we tried to shoo them off, more and more came flocking like leeches. We were not spared until we had walked a good kilometre. We found a decent hotel near the Ram Mandir just below the Mall road. The hotel couldn't have chosen a more generic name - _Tourist Hotel_!

It was definitely cleaner than the hotel I had stayed in Mandi.](IMG_20151222_185201.jpg)](http://sauvikbiswas.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/IMG_20151222_185201.jpg) The hotel had average rooms for the 650 rupees we paid per night.

Krishna and I walked up to Mall road. I kind of dragged him into a place called _Himachali Rasoi_. They promised authentic Himachali thali. While I loved the food, Krishna did not enjoy some of the items.

Krishna would be leaving tomorrow morning for sightseeing. Sadly, I will not have enough time to do so. I might walk around and explore the vicinity.
