About two or three weeks ago, I started having pain in my lower back. It did not restrict any of my movements but prolonged sitting caused fatigue and pain.

A visit to a physiotherapist confirmed that it was indeed caused by muscle stress. My poor sitting posture coupled with my [tight hamstrings](/posts/day-2-mysore-to-kalpetta/) were the culprit. The diagnosis sheet also read "core muscle weakness". The doctor administered ultrasound and interferential therapy on my back for five days.

I was given some exercises that stretches the lower back and glutes. The exercises are pretty simple. I can barely feel anything while doing them. It's usually after an hour or so that I can feel some pain and discomfort. The doctor had warned me about this. She had mentioned that it was merely like the exercise induced pain one gets after a heavy workout. It should not deter me from performing regular movements.

Here are the things I have learned and / or was instructed to do.

1. [Sitting is the new smoking](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/Warning-Sitting-is-the-new-smoking/articleshow/34691938.cms). Don't sit for more than 15 mins at a stretch.
2. While sitting gluteus and lumbar support is a must.
3. Don't slouch. If you find yourself involuntarily slouching, it is a sign of weak core muscles.

I have started doing regular stretches and have also bought an office chair to write and watch anime! (How ironic!) I plan to migrate to a standing workspace in a few months time.
