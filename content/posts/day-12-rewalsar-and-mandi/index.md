## My camera ditched me

I was using a Sony Cybershot point-and-shoot (DSC-W630) to capture the images of this trip. That small form factor camera has been my companion in the last three trips, too. Me and my sister have been using it for the last three years.

It was quite foggy today morning. The moment I took the first picture, the screen flickered and turned white.

Later in the afternoon, I took the camera to [a local repair shop in Mandi](http://www.justdial.com/Mandi/Malhotra-Studio-%3Cnear%3E-Uco-Bank-Mandi-Ho/9999P1905-1905-140626160312-Y5Q5_BZDET). The repair guy took a look at it and said that the display might be damaged. At best, it would be ready in 4-5 days. I will be leaving Mandi tomorrow and it made no sense to leave the camera when there were uncertainties in dates.

Few people had commented earlier that I should get a better camera. Maybe it’s time.

Anyways, I have my four year old Samsung Note 1. It’s camera is not even upto the marks but it can do the job for the remaining days of my trip. The only problem is that it’s showing signs of ageing and its battery doesn’t hold that good.

## Rewalsar is a hidden gem

There are two ways to get to [Rewalsar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rewalsar,_India) from Mandi. One route winds through the villages and takes about three hours. The other is a direct route and takes about one and half hours. It is better to ask the bus conductor which route he will be taking.

If I knew beforehand what an awesome place Rewalsar is, I would have planned a day or two in Rewalsar. It is one of those peaceful places where I can stay for days.

The place is built around a lake, [the Rewalsar Lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rewalsar_Lake). It houses three Tibetan Buddhist monasteries, one Gurudwara and a few small temples. Like all Buddhist places, it is recommended that one treads the lake in a clockwise fashion.

A huge statue of Padmasambhava greets the incoming buses. This statue was built over a period of eleven years. It was completed in 2012.

{{< figure src="IMG_20151216_112348.jpg" caption="Zangdok Palri or the Lotus Light temple of Padmasambhava is located diametrically opposite to the huge idol. Every corner, including the three levels of the palace itself is open to the general public. There is a meditation centre adjacent to this building." >}}

The lake itself is a very peaceful place. I saw a lot of different types of people walking around or sitting beside the lake.

There is also a government high school adjoining the lake. The road from the Padmasambhava idol to the lake passes right through the school premises.

I had a late breakfast near the lake in a small Tibetan shop. The owner's son was jumping around. He had put a temporary tattoo on the back of his palm and kept explaining how to put it on.

## Mandi on foot

It is possible to traverse the entire town limits of Mandi on foot. TripAdvisor showed three places of interest nearby. All three were religious places. The location of one of them is not proper. The other two are within walking distances from the bus stand. Since I was back in Mandi by 2:30, I decided to much on some peanuts and visit these places.

There is a cluster of temples around the Triloknath temple, flaking either sides of the Beas river. The entire area has been taken over by ASI. These temples are about five centuries old and are still in pristine condition.

{{< figure src="IMG_20151216_162059.jpg" caption="The Triloknath temple is on the National Highway. Some old idols are kept on display." >}}

{{< figure src="IMG_20151216_152654.jpg" caption="This is a Shiva temple just on the opposite bank of the Triloknath temple. Triloknath temple's spire is visible between the two spires." >}}

The location of Bhimakali temple is wrong on TripAdvisor. Google Maps, on the other hand, shows the right coordinates. TripAdvisor made me walk some extra 5 kms.

{{< figure src="IMG_20151216_164831.jpg" caption="The Bhimakali temple is situated right beside the bridge that connects Mandi and Kullu." >}}

{{< figure src="IMG_20151216_170757.jpg" caption="Guru Govind Singh's Gurudwara is right opposite to the temple." >}}

Unknowingly, I invaded a private function organised by the Dayanand Arya Vidyamandir. I thought it was some sort of fair.
