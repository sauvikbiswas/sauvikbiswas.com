A few days ago, I had placed an order for tea from [Namring Tea Estate](http://www.darjeelingteaboutique.com/namring-tea-estate/). It was the first time I had placed an order for a first flush.

Last week I received the package from [TeaBox.com](http://teabox.com). {{< figure src="tea" caption="Stuff in the (tea)box!" >}}

I will be honest. Even though I have paid good money for the Upper Namring first flush, I loved the Margaret's Hope second flush more. Maybe, the former was lighter than what I am used to. Maybe, it would take some more cups before I start enjoying it.

Initially, I did not like the Dark Chocolate Delight. In fact, I openly cursed it at my office. However, it grew on me as the stock neared its end (Their sample sized packets are supposed to make 4 cups. I could comfortably make 5.) I finished it today and to tell the truth, I could have a few more cups of its rose flavoured goodness.

I gave the Wayanard sample to Rueben. His wife drinks milk tea and could enjoy it better than a lactose intolerant guy like me. She said that she liked it. I guess it would be appreciated by people who love the intense flavour of CTC tea boiled in milk.
