## Breakfast at Dalhousie Bus Stop

I had already decided that I would not extend my stay in Dalhousie. The town is designed to accommodate honeymooning couples and families on a leisure trip (and the parents of DPS students and the army guys). I wanted to get to Dharamshala. So, I booked a hotel room online and asked Sanjay of Megha View regarding how to get there.

There are two direct buses. The first bus to Dharamshala leaves at 7:00 am. Since my hotel was 4.5 kms away from the bus stand, it would have been an arduous task to catch that bus. The second bus was at 11:45 am. I decided to target that and not hurry.

Fortunately, I did not have to walk the entire stretch. I caught a bus coming from Khajjiar and got to Dalhousie bus stop in fifteen minutes. I also had my breakfast there. The owner of a shop called Popular Stores proclaimed that sandwiches are their speciality.

## Buses stop anywhere and everywhere

The bus started on time. At around 2:00 pm, it stopped at a junction called Lahru. I had a modest vegetarian meal comprising of two rotis, cauliflower fry, dal and [kadhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kadhi). After my meal, I clicked a few pictures of the place.

Things started getting worse from here. The buses in the hills stop even if one person waves his hand. In fact, that's how I got on the bus towards Dalhousie bus stop in the morning. Probably, today was one of those auspicious days for marriage. I saw many decorated tents erected for marriage on my way. A lot of people, after attending these marriages, hopped on to the bus. This not only made the bus crowded, but delayed it considerably.

## Substitutions!

When the bus hit NH 20 at Dramman, the conductor said that the bus would not go till Dharamshala. He promised to make suitable arrangements for me. Apparently, I was the only one who had intended to travel the entire 125 km stretch and I still had 25 kms to cover. He put me on a bus that was headed to Kangra. This second bus conductor dropped me at Gaggal, showed me a parked bus and said that the bus would take me to Dharamshala. He also gave me seventeen rupees for my next ticket.

When I reached Dharamshala market, it was already well past 6:00 pm. I had unintentionally violated one of my principles - that I would not travel beyond 5:00 pm in the hills.

I checked maps and found that reaching hotel (which was in McLeod Ganj) by walk would be a 2.5 km uphill battle through a dark road with a 14 kg load on my back. The gentler slop via NH 503 was about 10 kms. I took the easy (and the sensible) way out, paid 150 rupees to a taxi and landed at Hotel Tokyo House.

The guy at Hotel Tokyo House offered me a better room in a better hotel called Backpackers Inn without any extra charge.

By the time I had settled myself and freshened up, it was 7:15 pm. Most shops had already shut down. I strolled through the area and got into the first Tibetan restaurant that I encountered. Finally, I had some food that was right up my alley.
