## Spare tube stuff

After that puncture last Sunday, I repaired the tube (and posted a photo). What I didn't realise was that the nail had done more damage than just punching one hole. Long story short, the tube was damaged beyond repair and I was out of patch kits.

I had no spare tubes left. So, I immediately placed an order for four Conti Race tubes and a patch kit. [Mastermind Bicycle Studio](http://www.mastermindbikes.in/welcome.html) were prompt in delivering them. Here they are:

The good part is that these tubes are compatible with 700x25c tyres in case I decide to swap my 700x23c's.

## Borrowed Mobius stuff

One of my colleagues, Dhananjay Deshmukh (a tech enthusiast in general and an aspiring ham radio operator in specific), lent me his [Mobius Actioncam](https://www.mobius-actioncam.com/) so that I can mount it on my cycle handlebar and shoot some footages of my weekend rides.

I had the mount of [my stolen bike light](/posts/theft-of-bicycle-accessories-from-my-office-parking-lot/). I unscrewed the top channel. And lo and behold! I was left with the nicest bike mount for the Mobius cam. Two zip ties did the rest of the job.

I mounted it on the handlebar and took some sample videos. The quality is pretty good. I will swap out Dhananjay's 2 GB MicroSD card with a spare 16 GB one lying somewhere in my boxes. That would give me some extra minutes of footage.
