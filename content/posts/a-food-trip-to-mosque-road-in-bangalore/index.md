During [this month of the Islamic calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramadan), the entire area of Mosque Road becomes a foodie's paradise. Me and two of my colleagues, Mainak and Rueben, made a trip to sample the food.

Here is a list of stuff we ate -

- Minced mutton seekh kebab
- Chicken kebab Malai Chicken tikka
- Patthar Beef (Meat roasted on a heated granite slab) with [Idiyappam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiyappam).
- Crab roll
- Mutton [Haleem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haleem)
- Phirni

P.S. The phirni was very good. I am having one right now as I compose this blog post.

P.P.S. This entire trip was made possible because of two free Uber rides - one sponsored by Rueben and the other by Mainak.
