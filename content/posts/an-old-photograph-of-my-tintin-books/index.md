This was in August 2010. I had just finished buying all the Tintin albums. Procurement was a dreadfully slow process, bottlenecked by the small stipend that I was getting from my University.

Back then I posted this on Facebook and wrote - _"All 24 official books of Tintin laid out on two pieces of plywood on the floor which also doubles up as my bed._ _Herge was a genius."_

The Facsimile editions and **_The Lake of Sharks_** were not featured here.
