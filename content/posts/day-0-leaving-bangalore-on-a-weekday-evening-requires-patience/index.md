## Minimalist packing

Tigerair allows a carry-on allowance of max 2 pieces with a combined weight not exceeding 10 kg. Or so the tag says. I made sure that I pack the lightest stuff, eg. tracksuits that weigh no more than 100-200 g each.

## A test of patience

The wait time is a true test of patience. Firstly, a person needs a lot of patience to travel from Mahadevpura (or HSR for Nandy - my travel partner) to the Bangalore airport on a weekday. That too, during the evening when everyone is commuting from their office to their home. I left about 3 hours early. I barely had 45 mins to check-in when I reached the airport.

The 3 lone counters of Tigerair is operated by Air India staff. They were helpful enough with the process and the immigration-customs-security checks were relatively fast.

A colleague of mine\* suggested that I make a note of all the stuff in the duty free shops en route to my destination. That way I can pick things up on my way back and I do not have to worry about lugging around too much weight.
