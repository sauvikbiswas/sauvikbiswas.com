On page 95 of the book, Amrutha Patil writes "Overall, the heart of an atom is positively charged. Orbiting it are negatively charged particles - or are they serpent-like waves? - which outnumber the positive particles by far."

In truth, for a neutral atom, they are exactly the same. I hope the publisher corrects this mistake in subsequent editions.
