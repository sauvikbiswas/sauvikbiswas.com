## China vs Portugal

Today, Freshmenu goofed up my order royally. Although the goof up is pretty epic, it does have a happy ending. Today, they had two chicken based dishes on the menu and both were being served in a bowl.

I received a call within about 15 mins of placing my order from a Freshmenu delivery guy. He had got me the second item on the menu instead of the first. The bowl had a label that clearly said 'Hoisin Glazed Chicken'. The delivery boy insisted that it was a labelling error and what I was being given was indeed my order of Portuguese Chicken Bowl. I had Hoisin Glazed Chicken before, so I knew how it looked like. He couldn't fool me. He then tried to put forward the argument that both are rice based chicken dishes and both have the same price. I did not buy into his baseless reasoning. I called up their customer care, who then asked me to return the bowl. They also promised me that I would receive my replacement order in fifteen minutes.

They were true to their words. I got a call from a new delivery guy. When I went to collect my order, I found that they had packed another bowl of Hoisin Glazed Chicken! Again! Well, there were more bowls in his delivery bag but none of them had anything from Portugal!

This delivery guy asked me not to file a complaint and to take the _Chinese import_. He also promised that he would get me my Portuguese order. 'Sir, have both,' he said. He explained that the guys who prepare the delivery bags and the guys who deliver are under immense stress between 11:30 am to 2:30 pm. The sheer volume of order forces them to make errors

I was feeling quite hungry at that point. I had given up the hope of getting my order. Instead, I reasoned that my stress level was lower than the stress levels of the two guys who had packed my first bowl and the second replacement bowl respectively and gulped down whatever I was given.

By the time I was done with my bowl, I got another call from a third Freshmenu delivery guy. He finally handed me my original order of the Portugese Chicken Rice bowl.

I was already full. I did not have the appetite for another bowl. Instead, I packed it for dinner. Well, it tasted pretty good with some mini _papad_.
