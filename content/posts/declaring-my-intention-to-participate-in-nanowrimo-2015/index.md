The challenge statement of NaNoWriMo is simple. Write a novel of 50,000 words in 30 days. I will have the time between November 1st 0000 hrs to November 30th 2359 hrs to accomplish this task. I will also be attempting this marathon for the first time. This makes me a bit nervous. I have put up a small widget in the right sidebar that will allow anyone to see my progress. I will be uploading segments and chapters to my website for archival during the entire month.

I had earlier attempted to write a long form serialisation. It was a mix of manga style storytelling with awkward humour in the veins of Monty Python. While I liked the style, I hated the fact that I wasn’t focusing on any particular plot. In a sense it felt like a soap opera (and the fact that no soap company was paying for the ad slots did not help).

I will be writing an Adventure story. I will borrow a few colourful characters and a few concepts from the serialisation, including the titular character, Knudalce. However, I will write an entire new plot from scratch.

I am a novice. Thus, in order to accomplish this feat, I will have to take a lot of precautions and preparations. Keeping the motivation level high would be the biggest challenge.
