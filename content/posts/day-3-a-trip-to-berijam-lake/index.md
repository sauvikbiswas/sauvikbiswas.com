Our hotel did not disappoint us with the breakfast. We checked out at 10:00 am. Prakash was late because he had gone to get permission for our visit to Berijam Lake and was stuck in the traffic.

Meanwhile, I went around clicking some photographs.

**A note about Hotel Sierra:** The hotel was a decent budget hotel, suited for someone looking for a vacation outside the din and hustle of the town. The owner, Chinna, helped me make all arrangements and bookings. We also got a well ventilated corner room. The tap water wasn't that good. It could be a problem of the area we were staying in (Naidupuram). And the guys can't cook decent rotis and gravies (as evident from yesterday's photograph).

Berijam Lake is situated right at the heart of the Palani Hills Forest. We couldn't go there because one has to get a permit from the Forest Department. It costs INR 300 and has to be obtained between 8:30 to 9:30 am. Thankfully, Prakash took care of all the hassles.

There are a few spots en route that offer unobstructed views of the valleys on either sides.

Before dropping us off at the town's seven roads junction, Prakash took us to the Suicide Point, a spot that we had missed yesterday.

Prakash took us to the shop in front of the chocolate factory. My sister bought some chocolates that she wanted to carry back to Kolkata. We also had our lunch at a hotel on the first floor - some value for money biriyanis and chicken fry (They called it Chicken 65).

Prakash dropped us at the lake. At present, I am drafting this post at the same Cafe Coffee Day I had visited the day before yesterday. Our bus leaves at 7:00 pm tonight.
