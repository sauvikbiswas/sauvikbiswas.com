Last Friday, I came across a bag full of building blocks in my colleague, Rueben's apartment. It was gifted to his son, Rehaan, by a Japanese lady who used to stay in the same building.

There was a worn out instruction manual that made reading the actual name of the product difficult. The company that made it, Gakken, [has a website](http://gakken.co.jp) but has such a diverse set of portfolio that I couldn't find anything regarding the product at all.

I later discovered that this product belongs to a division called Gakken Station Full (abbreviated as Sta:Ful) and has [a dedicated website](http://www.gakkensf.co.jp/).

With some bit of help from another friend, Ravish, I made an aircraft.

I was able to track it on Amazon India. The box costs a whopping 12,000 INR. There is a newer version of the box called [New Blocks Volume Set](http://www.amazon.com/Gakken-New-Block-Volume-Set/dp/B005LYCEWW/ref=dp_ob_title_toy) that costs about 290 USD but it isn't available in India.
